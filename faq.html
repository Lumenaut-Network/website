			<h2>What is inflation</h2>
			<p>Inflation is a nominal mechanism which distributes new lumens, in a weekly basis and at a rate of 1% per year to the holders. The inflation is distributed using a voting mechanism, if an address does not have the minimum requirments to get over 0.05% of the votes, then can vote to a pool. The pool is where the community can gather together and vote all their Lumens (XLM) to reach the minimum requirement, so Stellar Development Foundation pays the inflation. Basically, it means that if you're a Lumen's holder then you receive free Lumens.</p>

			<p>To read more about Inflation please go the <a href="https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/inflation.html">official</a> documentation.</p>

			<h2>Why use Lumenaut Pool</h2>
			<p>Due to the lack of a working and good public pool we decided to do something better where no fee will be taken from you and you will receive the full fair amount you deserve. By joining our pool you will not encounter any problem and you will not lose any of your Lumens. Everything is 100% safe.</p>

			<h2>How to vote to Lumenaut Pool</h2>

			<p>Voting is done by setting the option Inflation Destination in your wallet to our account ID. The number of votes you have is equal to your balance, so if you have 100 XLM then you have 100 votes.</p>
