			<h2>What is inflation</h2>
			<p>Inflation is a nominal mechanism which offers free Lumens (XLM) to holders, to receive the Lumens an address can vote to a pool. The pool is where the community can gather together and join all their Lumens (XLM) to reach the minimum requirement, so Stellar pays the inflation.</p>
			
			<p>Basically, it means that if you're a Lumen's holder then you receive free Lumens. Due to the lack of a working and good public pool we wanted to do something better where nothing will be taken from you and you will receive the fair amount you deserve. By joining our pool you will not encounter any problem and you will not lose any of your Lumens. Everything is 100% safe.

			<p>To read more about Inflation please go the <a href="https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/inflation.html">official</a> documentation.</p>
