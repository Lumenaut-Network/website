			<h2>Join Lumenaut Pool</h2>

				<p>First of all, you need to transfer your Lumens to a wallet controlled by you. If you keep your Lumens in an exchange then the exchange may receive the inflation and will not pay you.</p>
				<p>A simple way to vote for Lumenaut is to register an account with <a href="https://stellarx.com" target="_blank">StellarX</a> which is an official GUI for the Stellar distributed exchange, an ineherit exchange at protocol level. StellarX is using Lumenaut to pay the inflation to their users, by using StellarX you can skip all steps shown bellow which may result in a simple way to vote for our pool.</p>

			<h2>What Is Inflation</h2>
			<p>Inflation is a nominal mechanism that distributes new Lumens. This event occurs on a weekly basis, at a rate of 1% per year to existing holders. The inflation is distributed using a voting system whereby those with 0.05% of the total votes qualify for the new Lumens. To read more about the inflation process, please consult the official documentation on <a href="https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/inflation.html">Stellar.org</a>.</p>

			<p>If your address doesn't meet the minimum required votes, then you can still receive the inflation by joining an inflation pool. The inflation pool is a way the community can gather and vote together to reach the minimum required votes. The inflation is paid to the pool and then divided between the members based on account size. Basically, it means that if you're a holder then you receive free Lumens every week!</p>

			<h2>Requirements of Lumenaut Pool</h2>
			<p>To receive inflation payments from Lumenaut you need to fulfil one requirement called Lumenaut Minimum Balance. The minimum balance you need to be able to receive inflation payments trough Lumenaut Pool is 2.5 XLM, we don't distribute payments to accounts with less than 2.5 XLM. Lumenaut Minimum Balance requirement is adopted to discourage bots from spamming the network with activity that emerges and disappears while the payments are processed, which repeatedly interrupts or slows the inflation distribution process.</p>
			<p>If your address has 2.5 XLM or more, but between the inflation airdrop and the time Lumenaut Pool starts distributing payments you delete your address, or merge it with another address, we will not pay you since your old address doesn't exist in the network. If you want to delete your address but you're voting for Lumenaut Pool, please wait for the inflation payment distribution and then delete your address, because obviously, you will stop receiving payments if your address is deleted.</p>

			<h2>How Much Inflation You Receive</h2>
			<p>To know how much you will receive in the next inflation payment, enter your XLM amount or Public Key below for the estimate.</p>
			<div class="calculator">
				<input type="text" placeholder="XLM amount or Public Key...">
				<small>We don't store anything on our server, calculation is done locally on your browser. <a href="https://github.com/Lumenaut-Network/website/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">More Info</a></small>

			</div>

			<h2>When Is The Inflation Payment</h2>
			<p>Inflation is usually distributed by the Stellar network on Tuesdays at 00:00 UTC. Processing on our end should take no more than a few minutes after that. As a result, you should receive your portion of the inflation distribution every Tuesday at around 00:00 UTC.</p>

			<h2>Why Use Lumenaut Pool</h2>
			<p>Currently, there are other pools but they charge fees or gamble with the inflation payouts of their users. Due to the lack of a trustworthy or fair pool - we decided to create something better where no fees will be subtracted from your payment. You will receive the full and fair amount of your share of the weekly inflation distribution.</p>

			<h2>Voting To Lumenaut Pool</h2>
			<p>Voting is done by setting the customizable option of Inflation Destination to our address. Your vote is equal to the number of Lumens you hold and the inflation payment you receive is proportionate to the amount of your holdings. The more Lumens you hold - the more Lumens you receive via inflation. Joining Lumenaut Pool doesn't change the fact that you can use your address/wallet like you normally would. Everything is automatic!</p>

			<h2>Revote of Inflation Destination</h2>
			<p>Your inflation destination only needs to be set once. The option is tied to your address, not your tokens. So, as long as your address has the Lumens, you will automatically receive your share of the inflation distribution.</p>

			<h2>Safety of Lumenaut Pool</h2>
			<p>Inflation destination is a native component of the Stellar network. It is 100% safe because Lumenaut Pool only has access to your Public Key, which is the address you use to vote for us so we can know who you are and send you the inflation payment every week.</p>

			<h2>Use Of Secret Key To Set Inflation Destination</h2>
			<p>Every transaction or option set in your address needs to be signed with your Secret Key, to make sure the person issuing the action is the true owner of the address. This process is a good thing, it results in heightened security for your holdings. These are preventative measures to block any third party from setting the inflation destination of your address without your consent.</p>
			<p>Depending on the wallet you have and the tutorial you follow - you may need to use your Secret Key to set the inflation destination. For the most part, you will be safe since your Secret Key will be used with your wallet or on the official Stellar website. In case you have trust issues, which is understandable, it's important for you to note that your Secret Key isn't shared with us. We don't need to know your Secret Key and we don't want to. So, there's nothing we can do to damage you or steal your funds.</p>

		<section id="about">
			<h2>What is Lumenaut</h2>
			<p>Lumenaut name is a play-on-words based on “lumen” and “naut”. The word “lumen” refers to the Stellar’s network crypto-asset called Lumen and the word “naut” refers to astronaut or cosmonaut. The collective is formed by users that met in the official <a href="https://reddit.com/r/stellar">Stellar subreddit</a>.</p>

			<p>Lumenaut seeks to improve Stellar ecosystem with the new services and continuously improve the existing ones already given by Lumenaut. We don’t develop a service/product already offered by other entity unless we can do something better, this way Stellar benefits from a more healthy ecosystem since we don’t contribute for a saturation in the network.</p>

			<p>Lumenaut quickly became a way for users to collectively refer to themselves as a “lumenaut”. If you like Stellar and hold Lumens (XLM) then you’re a lumenaut, just like us.</p>

			<h2>How To Help Lumenaut</h2>
			<p>We try to improve the Stellar community and ecosystem. If you would like to contribute to our cause and help us so all our services can run smoothly, you can donate Lumens (XLM) to our donation’s address shared below and help us achieve at least USD $80 per month.</p>

			<address class="addr addrDonation">
				<img class="qrCode" src="assets/img/qrDonate.png" alt="QR Code">
				<a data-clipboard-text="GDHJIGNUZDEH6T2PU7HBPGGJUUWTMMEENDFVMGIJO2KV7JEBBLDONATE">GDHJIGNUZDEH6T2PU7HBPGGJUUWTMMEENDFVMGIJO2KV7JEBBLDONATE</a>
			</address>

			<p>If you can't donate, you can still help us by spreading the word about our services to other persons, make blog posts, refer us, join our media platforms, suggest ideas, contribute code, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/stellar">help translating</a> our website to your language... Or simply just use the Lumenaut Pool, the more votes we have the stronger we're because if some users decide to leave the pool we can still have the minimum requirement to keep receiving the inflation from the Stellar network.</p>
